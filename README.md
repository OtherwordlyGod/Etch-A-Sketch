# Etch-A-Sketch
Project Etch-A-Sketch from The Odin Project

In this project, I will create a browser version of etch a sketch. This will be created using DOM manipulation and a grid of divs. The completed project should allow the user to customize how big they want thier canvas to be as well as draw whenever mouse is down. When drawing, the divs should change colors and progresively get darker. This project will display my current DOM manipulation skills as well as my CSS skills.
